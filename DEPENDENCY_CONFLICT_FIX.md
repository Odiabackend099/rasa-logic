# 🔧 Dependency Conflict Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Issue:** Build failing due to `rasa-sdk` version conflict

---

## ❌ Error

```
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 1) and rasa-sdk==3.6.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested rasa-sdk==3.6.1
    rasa 3.6.12 depends on rasa-sdk<3.7.0 and >=3.6.2
```

## ✅ Solution

### Problem:
- `rasa==3.6.12` (in `requirements.txt`) requires `rasa-sdk>=3.6.2`
- `actions/requirements.txt` had `rasa-sdk==3.6.1` (too old)

### Fix:
Changed `actions/requirements.txt`:
- **Before:** `rasa-sdk==3.6.1`
- **After:** `rasa-sdk>=3.6.2`

---

## 📝 Updated File

**File:** `actions/requirements.txt`

```txt
rasa-sdk>=3.6.2
supabase>=2.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
```

---

## ✅ Status

- ✅ Fixed dependency conflict
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Ready for redeploy

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait for auto-redeploy** (Render should detect the change)
2. **OR manually trigger:**
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"

### Expected Result:
- ✅ Dependencies should install successfully
- ✅ No more `ResolutionImpossible` error
- ✅ Build should complete

---

**Status:** Fixed and ready to deploy! 🎉
