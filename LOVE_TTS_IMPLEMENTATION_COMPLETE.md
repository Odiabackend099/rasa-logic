## 🎯 **What I've Built**

I've successfully implemented a **60-second soft TTS response** about the true meaning of love that integrates seamlessly with your Rasa system. Here's the complete implementation:

## 📝 **The Beautiful Response (1,294 characters)**

```
The true meaning of love whispers to us in the quiet moments between heartbeats. 

Love is not just an emotion, but a choice we make each day. It's the gentle touch that says 
"you matter" without words. It's seeing someone's flaws and choosing to stay, not despite them, 
but because they make that person beautifully human.

True love is patient. It doesn't rush or demand, but waits with open arms. It's the safety 
of knowing someone will catch you when you fall, and the courage to let yourself be vulnerable.

Love is found in small gestures - a warm cup of coffee on a cold morning, a listening ear 
after a difficult day, or simply sitting together in comfortable silence. It's choosing 
kindness when anger would be easier.

The deepest love starts with loving yourself - accepting your own imperfections and treating 
yourself with the same compassion you'd show a dear friend. Only then can you truly give 
love to others.

Love is not possession, but freedom. It's wanting the best for someone, even if that means 
letting them go. It's celebrating their dreams and supporting their journey, wherever it 
may lead.

In the end, love is the thread that connects all hearts, the light that guides us home, 
and the gentle reminder that we are never truly alone in this beautiful, complex world.
